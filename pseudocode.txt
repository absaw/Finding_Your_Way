how long? = short sequences. Verify this yourselves

For e.g. 

Down Operation:

Above Cell --  | A |
Current Cell-- | C |
Below Cell--   | B |
                
#Prob is like flow=>P(inside) - P(outside)
P(Cnext)=P(Cnow)+P_in - P_out 

If A is wall
    P_in = 0
else
    P_in = P(A)

If B is wall
    P_out = 0
else
    P_out = P(C)
